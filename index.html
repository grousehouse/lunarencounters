  <h2>Lifetime Heats Calculator</h2>
  <p>This calculator will tell you have many heats your wolf has left before they die. This assumes that your wolf is always bred on the first day of their heat. If you plan on instant delivering every one of your wolf's litters right after they are bred, select the checkbox below that indicates this.</p>

<!-- Unbred/Male Heat Calculator -->
<div id="SexChange" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Unbred/Male Heats Calculator</h2>
  <p>Every wolf, regardless of sex, has a heat cycle! It doesn't show on male wolves, but it coorelates to their age. Depending on their age, a male wolf might go immediately into heat when they're sex changed. This calculator will tell you if your male wolf would be in heat if you were to sex change them, or how far away their heat would be!<br><br>Using an aging crystal on a pup or adolescent messes with this heat cycle. Aging crystal functionality coming soon!<br></p>
